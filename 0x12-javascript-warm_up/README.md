# JavaScript Warm-Up

This repository contains a set of JavaScript scripts to help you get started with JavaScript programming. 
These scripts cover a range of basic concepts and tasks, and they are designed to help you build a strong foundation in JavaScript.

## Background Context

JavaScript is a versatile programming language that is used for both scripting and building web front-end applications. 
In this project, you will primarily focus on scripting to learn the fundamental concepts of JavaScript before applying 
them to a more complex project.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, I achieved the following learning objectives:


- Understanding why JavaScript programming is powerful and versatile.
- Knowing how to run a JavaScript script.
- Creating variables and constants using `let` and `const`.
- Differentiating between `var`, `let`, and `const`.
- Understanding all available data types in JavaScript.
- Utilizizing `if`, `if ... else` statements for conditional logic.
- Adding comments to my  code for documentation.
- Assigning values to variables.
- Implementing `while` and `for` loops for iteration.
- Use `break` and `continue` statements to control loop execution.
- Defining and using functions.
- Recognizing the behavior of functions without a return statement.
- Understanding the scope of variables.
- Performing arithmetic operations.
- Manipulating dictionaries (objects).
- Importing external files.

## Requirements

- Use one of the allowed text editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Node.js (version 14.x).
- Ensure all your files end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/node`.
- Include a `README.md` file at the root of the project folder.
- Your code should be semistandard compliant (version 16.x.x). Follow the rules of Standard and include semicolons.
- Make sure all your files are executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.


## Tasks

The project contains several tasks, each with its own JavaScript script. Below is a brief description of each task:

1. **First constant, first print**
   - Print the message "JavaScript is amazing" using a constant variable.

2. **3 languages**
   - Print three lines with different messages.

3. **Arguments**
   - Print a message based on the number of arguments passed.

4. **Value of my argument**
   - Print the first argument passed to the script.

5. **Create a sentence**
   - Print two arguments in a specific format.

6. **An Integer**
   - Print a message if the first argument can be converted to an integer.

7. **Loop to languages**
   - Print three lines using an array of strings and a loop.

8. **I love C**
   - Print a message multiple times based on the argument passed.

9. **Square**
   - Print a square based on the size argument.

10. **Add**
    - Print the addition of two integers using a function.

11. **Factorial**
    - Compute and print the factorial of a number using recursion.

12. **Second biggest!**
    - Find and print the second biggest integer from a list of arguments.

13. **Object**
    - Update the value of a key in an object.

14. **Add file**
    - Create a function for adding two integers and make it visible externally.

Each task is implemented in its respective JavaScript file within the project directory.

## Usage

You can run each script individually to test the functionality. For example:

```
$ ./0-javascript_is_amazing.js
JavaScript is amazing
```

Make sure to follow the task-specific requirements for each script.
