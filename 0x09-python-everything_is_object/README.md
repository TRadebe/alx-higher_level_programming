0x09. Python - Everything is an object

Description

This project explores the concept of objects in Python and the difference between mutable and immutable objects. 
It covers topics such as object types, variable identifiers, object assignment, aliases, equality comparisons, and mutability.

Background Context

In this project, we delve deeper into how Python handles different types of objects and their behavior. 
We examine scenarios where variables may unintentionally modify other variables and discuss the reasons behind the observed outcomes.

The project consists of a series of tasks that involve answering questions and understanding Python's specific behavior. 
It is important to read the documentation, think critically, and brainstorm with peers before testing examples in the Python interpreter.

The project aims to develop a solid understanding of Python's unique features, which will be beneficial for interviews and 
Python programming positions.

Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

Understand what an object is
Differentiate between a class, an object, and an instance
Distinguish between immutable and mutable objects
Comprehend the concepts of reference, assignment, and aliasing
Determine if two variables are identical or linked to the same object
Display the variable identifier (memory address) in CPython implementation
Identify mutable and immutable built-in types in Python
Understand how Python passes variables to functions
Requirements
Python scripts: All scripts will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
Script format: All script files should start with #!/usr/bin/python3 and end with a newline character.
Code style: The code should comply with PEP 8 style guidelines (pycodestyle version 2.8.*).
Executable files: All files must have executable permissions.
README.md: A README.md file must be present at the root of the project folder.
Text answer files: Each answer file should contain only one line without a shebang and end with a newline character.
Tasks
This project consists of several tasks. Each task requires answering a specific question or predicting the output of a given code snippet. 
The answer should be provided in a separate text file for each task.

The task files are located in the following directory of the GitHub repository: alx-higher_level_programming/0x09-python-everything_is_object

The task files are named in the format <task_number>-answer.txt, where <task_number> corresponds to the task number.

For example, the answer file for task 0 would be named 0-answer.txt, and the answer file for task 1 would be named 1-answer.txt.

Testing

There are no specific test cases for this project. However, you should ensure that your answers are correct by carefully understanding the concepts and verifying them through experimentation or research.
