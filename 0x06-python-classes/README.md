# Square

This project focuses on creating a `Square` class and implementing various features related to object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python. The `Square` class represents a square shape and allows for manipulation of its attributes.

## Background Context

In this project, we explore the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python and focus on creating a `Square` class. 
The project includes various tasks that involve defining class attributes, implementing instance methods, using properties, 
validating input values, and printing square patterns.

It is essential to read the provided resources and gain a thorough understanding of OOP concepts, class attributes, methods, 
encapsulation, information hiding, and other related topics. 
Make sure to experiment with the code examples and practice the concepts on your own.
