# Python Object Relational Mapping (ORM) Project

This project is part of the ALX Higher-Level Programming curriculum and focuses on using Python to interact with a MySQL database. 
In this project, we'll be exploring two approaches: using the `MySQLdb` module for direct SQL queries and using `SQLAlchemy`, 
a popular ORM tool for Python.

## Project Tasks

This project consists of several tasks, each involving Python scripts that interact with a MySQL database. Here is an overview of the tasks:

0. **Get all states**: Retrieve a list of all states from the database.
1. **Filter states**: Retrieve states whose names start with a specific letter.
2. **Filter states by user input**: Retrieve states based on user input (safe from SQL injection).
3. **SQL Injection...**: Demonstrate SQL injection vulnerability and create a safe version of the previous task.
4. **Cities by states**: List all cities from a database.
5. **All cities by state**: List all cities of a specific state.
6. **First state model**: Define a State class using SQLAlchemy.
7. **All states via SQLAlchemy**: Retrieve and display all State objects using SQLAlchemy.
8. **First state**: Retrieve and display the first State object.
9. **Contains 'a'**: List states that contain the letter 'a'.
10. **Get a state**: Retrieve the id of a state by name.
11. **Add a new state**: Add a new state to the database and print its id.
12. **Update a state**: Update the name of a State object.
13. **Delete states**: Delete states with names containing the letter 'a'.
14. **Cities in state**: Define a City class and retrieve cities by state.

## Getting Started

Before you start, make sure you have a MySQL server installed and running. Additionally, you should have Python 3.8 or later 
installed on your system.
