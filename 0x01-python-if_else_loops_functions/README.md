Project: Python If-Else, Loops, and Functions

This repository contains Python scripts and C scripts that demonstrate various concepts related to if-else statements, loops, and functions.
The scripts are designed to run on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5 and GCC (GNU Compiler Collection).
Please make sure you have the required environment to run the scripts.

Requirements
Python scripts should be edited using one of the allowed editors: vi, vim, or emacs.
All Python files must end with a new line.
The first line of all Python files should be #!/usr/bin/python3.
A README.md file, located at the root of the project folder, is mandatory.
Python scripts should follow the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) guidelines for code style and formatting.
All Python files must have executable permissions.
The length of Python files will be tested using the wc command.
C scripts should be edited using one of the allowed editors: vi, vim, or emacs.
All C files must end with a new line.
C scripts should be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using GCC with the following options: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
The prototypes of all functions used in the C scripts should be included in a header file called lists.h.
The header files should be include guarded.
C scripts should follow the Betty style guidelines, which will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
The use of global variables is not allowed.
Each C file should contain no more than 5 functions.
Project Structure
The project directory contains the following files and directories:

0-positive_or_negative.py: This Python script assigns a random signed number to the variable number and prints whether the number is positive,
negative, or zero when executed.

1-last_digit.py: This Python script assigns a random signed number to the variable number and prints the last digit of the number along
with additional information.

2-print_alphabet.py: This Python script prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, without a newline.

3-print_alphabt.py: This Python script prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e', without a newline.

4-print_hexa.py: This Python script prints numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal format.

5-print_comb2.py: This Python script prints numbers from 0 to 99, separated by commas and a space.

6-print_comb3.py: This Python script prints all possible different combinations of two digits, separated by commas and a space.

7-islower.py: This Python script defines a function islower(c) that checks if a character is lowercase.

8-uppercase.py: This Python script defines a function uppercase(str) that prints a string in uppercase.

lists.h: This header file contains the function prototypes for the C scripts.

Usage

To run any of the Python scripts, navigate to the project directory and execute the desired script using the Python interpreter.
