# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

## Description

This project focuses on test-driven development (TDD) in Python and covers various topics such as unit tests, doctest, documentation, 
and edge cases. It includes several tasks that require implementing functions and writing test cases for them.

## Concepts

The project emphasizes the following concept:

- familiarizing yourself with unit testing

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, i should be able to explain the following without external assistance:

- The awesomeness of Python programming
- Interactive testing and its importance
- Writing docstrings for tests
- Writing documentation for modules and functions
- Basic option flags for creating tests
- Identifying edge cases

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- Code should follow the PEP 8 style (pycodestyle version 2.8.*)
- All files must be executable
- The length of the files will be tested using `wc`

### Python Test Cases
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All test files should end with a new line
- All test files should be inside a folder named `tests`
- All test files should be text files with the extension `.txt`
- All tests should be executed using the command `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- All modules should have documentation using `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`
- All functions should have documentation using `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`
- Documentation should consist of complete sentences describing the purpose of the module, class, or method (length will be verified)
- Collaborating on test cases is strongly encouraged, as the Checker will be checking for them

## Tasks
1. Integers addition
2. Divide a matrix
3. Say my name
4. Print square
5. Text indentation
6. Max integer - Unittest
