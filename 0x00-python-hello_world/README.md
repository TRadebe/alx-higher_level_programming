# 0x00 Python - Hello, World

This directory contains Python scripts and C code examples for the "Hello, World" project of the Higher-Level Programming track at ALX - Holberton School.

## Tasks

### 0. Run Python file
* File: `0-run`
* A Shell script that runs a Python script.
* The Python file name will be saved in the environment variable `$PYFILE`.

### 1. Run inline
* File: `1-run_inline`
* A Shell script that runs Python code.
* The Python code will be saved in the environment variable `$PYCODE`.

### 2. Hello, print
* File: `2-print.py`
* A Python script that prints the string `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle"`, followed by a new line.

### 3. Print integer
* File: `3-print_number.py`
* A Python script that prints an integer stored in the variable `number`, followed by the string `"Battery street"`, followed by a new line.
* The integer is not cast into a string.

### 4. Print float
* File: `4-print_float.py`
* A Python script that prints a float stored in the variable `number` with a precision of 2 digits.
* The float is not cast into a string.

### 5. Print string
* File: `5-print_string.py`
* A Python script that prints a string stored in the variable `str` three times, followed by its first 9 characters.
* No loops or conditional statements are allowed.

### 6. Play with strings
* File: `6-concat.py`
* A Python script that prints `"Welcome to Holberton School!"` using the variables `str1` and `str2` only once.
* No loops or conditional statements are allowed.

### 7. Copy - Cut - Paste
* File: `7-edges.py`
* A Python script that copies the first three letters of the variable `word` into the variable `word_first_3`, the last two letters into `word_last_2`, and the value of `word` without the first and last letters into `middle_word`.
* No loops or conditional statements are allowed.

### 8. Create a new sentence
* File: `8-concat_edges.py`
* A Python script that prints `"object-oriented programming with Python"`, followed by a new line.
* No loops or conditional statements are allowed.

### 9. Easter Egg
* File: `9-easter_egg.py`
* A Python script that prints "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters.

### 10. Linked list cycle
* File: `10-check_cycle.c`, `lists.h`
* A C function that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle.
* Prototype: `int check_cycle(listint_t *list);`
* Returns: `0` if there is no cycle, `1` if there is a cycle.

## Repository

All files are part of the repository `alx-higher_level_programming`.

### Directory

The Python scripts and C code examples are located in the `0x00-python-hello_world` directory.

### How to Run

The Shell scripts can be executed in the terminal.
For C programs, you can compile them using `gcc` and run the resulting executable file.
